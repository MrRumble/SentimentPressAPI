# SentimentPressAPI

This repository contains the deployed backend and API for the SentimentPress project. It has been streamlined to run efficiently on an EC2 micro instance, focusing on database queries and API calls while offloading the heavy sentiment analysis tasks.

This repository includes the `insert_data` route, which allows data from the locally run backend to be posted to the EC2 database.

To see the full sentiment analysis workflow, including the heavy lifting, visit the [SentimentPressV2](https://github.com/MrRumble/SentimentPressV2) repository.
